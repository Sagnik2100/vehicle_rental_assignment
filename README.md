# vehicle_rental_assignment
This is a full-stack vehicle rental booking application developed as part of a technical assignment. The application allows users to fill out a dynamic multi-step form to book a vehicle by selecting the vehicle type, model, and rental date range. The backend handles data persistence and validation to ensure that bookings do not overlap.
